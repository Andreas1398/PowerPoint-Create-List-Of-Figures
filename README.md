# PowerPoint_ListOfFigures
This is a quick and dirty way of a macro which creates a list of figures automatically of your presentation.
It also adds a textbox beneath each figure with the caption.


Insert this file as a macro in PowerPoint or copy the text and paste it in an already created macro.

Useful tipps while using it:
- Figures inserted in text boxes might be excluded
- Figures which are grouped are excluded
- The last layer per slide is listed at first.
  So if the order of the list is not correct, put the figure which sould be further up to the background
- User inputs are marked with ' ### user input:
  1. Number of maximum lines per slide
  2. Name of the slide in the slide master (twice)
- The Alternative Text of a figure is used as the caption
- Rotated figures have a wrong placed text box in the slide itself as a result
